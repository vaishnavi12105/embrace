        <p class="intro-to-page">Becoming a mother is often painted as a joyful beginning — but the truth can be far more complicated. Postpartum depression, body image struggles, and emotional disconnect can leave you feeling lost, guilty, or overwhelmed. Maybe you feel numb. Maybe you feel resentment and don’t understand why. That doesn’t make you a bad mother — it makes you human. This space exists to hold those feelings without judgment. Whether you’re searching for peace, understanding, or simply the reminder that you're not alone, you belong here. Through stories, support, and care, we hope this room becomes a place to rest, reconnect, and remember: you matter too.</p>

            <p class="grief-text">
                Postpartum depression isn’t just sadness — it’s the heaviness that lingers when the world tells you to smile. It’s crying for no reason, feeling distant from your own baby, or feeling like you've lost pieces of who you were. And sometimes, it’s quiet resentment — not toward your child, but toward the exhaustion, the loneliness, the lack of space to just be. It’s okay to feel that. Your body has changed. Your life has shifted. Your needs still matter. This isn’t about failure — it’s about fatigue, hormones, and the weight of invisible expectations. Naming the feeling is powerful. Seeking support is brave. You are allowed to not be okay, and you are deserving of care, rest, and recovery.

            <p class="grief-text">
                Healing in motherhood doesn’t mean bouncing back — it means slowly becoming someone new, without losing the core of who you are. It may look like rediscovering your body with gentleness, having hard conversations with your partner, or carving out ten quiet minutes just for you. These small moments are powerful. You are not selfish for needing space, for grieving your old life, or for asking for more. You are allowed to want joy, comfort, intimacy, and peace. It will take time. You won’t always feel this way. There is no rush. There is no right way to be a mother. There is only your way. And you are doing better than you think.

                <p class="description">Hi, I’m Neha. A few years ago, I was diagnosed with endometriosis, and the doctors told me my chances of becoming a mother were very low. I experienced a miscarriage during my first pregnancy, and it shattered me. But deep inside, I knew I wasn’t ready to give up. I went through surgery, months of emotional and physical healing, and with the endless support of my husband and family, I decided to try again. Every step was filled with fear and prayer. But finally, I delivered a healthy baby boy. He’s my world now. To any mother struggling—please don’t lose hope. Your strength and patience will bring light to your darkest days.</p>

                <p class="description">I’m Radhika, and my journey to motherhood wasn’t easy. I had a tilted uterus and suffered two painful miscarriages that made me question my worth as a woman. I cried silently, feeling like my body was failing me. But I wasn’t ready to quit. I changed my doctor, followed every instruction carefully, and tried IVF. My first cycle failed. But I gave it one more shot. That second cycle gave me the happiest moment of my life—a healthy baby girl. Holding her made every tear worth it. If you’re a mother still waiting, please remember—your journey is unique, and your strength is unmatched. Keep going. You’re not alone in this.</p>

                <p class="description">Hello, I’m Anjali. I’ve struggled with PCOS since my early twenties. My periods were irregular, and every pregnancy attempt ended in disappointment. I felt left behind while others celebrated motherhood. After my first miscarriage, I felt defeated. But something inside me whispered to try again. I worked on my health, followed a balanced lifestyle, and took every bit of medical advice seriously. We tried again—and this time, everything changed. I carried my son full term and gave birth to a healthy baby. That moment erased all the pain. To all mothers still on their journey—have faith. Healing takes time, but your miracle is waiting for you too.</p>
